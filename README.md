# pure-black-theme-for-mochi-cards

I use [Mochi Cards](https://github.com/mochi-cards) and recently I found the black theme made (very beautiful) by [Elias](https://github.comeliaszon/Deep-Dark-Theme-For-Mochi), but I had to make some changes, removing the font because it didn't work in the desktop app.

I changed some shades of black, to fill the background and the cards because on my screen oled was very similar to the original gray, and I changed some color codes for my smartphone (which is not oled and was very dark ðŸ˜…).
